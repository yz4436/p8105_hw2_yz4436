### Problem 1

Import and clean date from
`NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv` and changed route 8-11
to character. Then change variable entry to logical variable and select
something that will be used later.

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

As it stands, these data are not “tidy”: route number should be a
variable, as should route. That is, to obtain a tidy dataset we would
need to convert `route` variables from wide to long format. This will be
useful when focusing on specific routes, but may not be necessary when
considering questions that focus on station-level variables.

The following code chunk selects station name and line, and then uses
`distinct()` to obtain all unique combinations. As a result, the number
of rows in this dataset is the number of unique stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    station_name             line    
    ##    <chr>                    <chr>   
    ##  1 25th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  2 36th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  3 45th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  4 53rd St                  4 Avenue
    ##  5 59th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  6 77th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  7 86th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  8 95th St                  4 Avenue
    ##  9 9th St                   4 Avenue
    ## 10 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue
    ## # … with 455 more rows

The next code chunk is similar, but filters according to ADA compliance
as an initial step. This produces a dataframe in which the number of
rows is the number of ADA compliant stations.

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    station_name                   line           
    ##    <chr>                          <chr>          
    ##  1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr       4 Avenue       
    ##  2 DeKalb Av                      4 Avenue       
    ##  3 Pacific St                     4 Avenue       
    ##  4 Grand Central                  42nd St Shuttle
    ##  5 34th St                        6 Avenue       
    ##  6 47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center 6 Avenue       
    ##  7 Church Av                      6 Avenue       
    ##  8 21st St                        63rd Street    
    ##  9 Lexington Av                   63rd Street    
    ## 10 Roosevelt Island               63rd Street    
    ## # … with 74 more rows

To compute the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending
allow entrance, we first exclude station entrances that do not allow
vending. Then, we focus on the `entry` variable – this logical, so
taking the mean will produce the desired proportion (recall that R will
coerce logical to numeric in cases like this).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

Lastly, we write a code chunk to identify stations that serve the A
train, and to assess how many of these are ADA compliant. As a first
step, we tidy the data as alluded to previously; that is, we convert
`route` from wide to long format. After this step, we can use tools from
previous parts of the question (filtering to focus on the A train, and
on ADA compliance; selecting and using `distinct` to obtain dataframes
with the required stations in rows).

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##    station_name                  line           
    ##    <chr>                         <chr>          
    ##  1 Times Square                  42nd St Shuttle

### Problem 2

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet with specifying the sheet in
the Excel file and to omit non-data entries using arguments in
read_excel, using reasonable variables, omitting rows that do not
include dumpster-specific data, and rounding the number of sports balls
to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable.
Then I create a new variable to indicate this is Mr. Trash Wheel and
locate it in the first column.

``` r
mr_trashwheel_df =
  read_excel(
    "Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, 0)),
    year = as.numeric(year),
    Trash_Wheel_Type = "Mr." 
  ) %>%
  relocate(Trash_Wheel_Type)
```

Import, clean, and organize the data for Professor Trash Wheel, and then
I create a new variable to indicate this is Professor Trash Wheel and
locate it in the first column. Finally, combining this with the
Mr. Trash Wheel dataset to produce a single tidy dataset.

``` r
professor_trashwheel_df =
  read_excel(
    "Data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", 
    sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel",
    range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(Trash_Wheel_Type = "Professor") %>%
  relocate(Trash_Wheel_Type)

combine_tidy = bind_rows(mr_trashwheel_df, professor_trashwheel_df)
```

-   The number of observations in the resulting dataset combine_tidy is
    641.
-   The number of variables in the resulting dateset combine_tidy is 15,
    which are Trash_Wheel_Type, dumpster, month, year, date,
    weight_tons, volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene,
    cigarette_butts, glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags,
    sports_balls, homes_powered and Trash_Wheel_Type is created by
    myself to indicate the which is Mr. Trash Wheel and which is
    Professor Trash Wheel.
-   The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheelis
    190.12 and the total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash
    Wheel in 2020 is 856.
